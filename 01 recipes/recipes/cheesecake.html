<h2>Descriptions</h2>

<p>
    Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Block cream cheese: Four 8-ounce blocks of full-fat cream cheese</li>
    <li>Sugar: 1 cup.</li>
    <li>Sour cream: 1 cup.</li>
    <li>1 cup Mushrooms diced</li>
    <li>A little flavor: 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract </li>
    <li>Eggs: 3 eggs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>And as always, make sure all of the cheesecake batter ingredients are at room temperature so the batter remains smooth, even, and combines quickly. </li>
    <li>Beating cold ingredients together will result in a chunky over-beaten cheesecake batter, hardly the way we want to start!</li>
</ol>
