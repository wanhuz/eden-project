            <p>A bird's eye takes up about 50 percent of its head; our eyes take up about 5 percent of our head. To be comparable to a bird's eyes, our eyes would have to be the size of baseballs. Register for more bird fact! </p>

            <div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/bird2.jpg" alt=""><p>All female birds lay eggs. Their baby birds then hatch out of the shells when they are ready. If you look up into the trees, you might be able to see a nest.</p></div>

            <div class="thumbnail"><img src="img/bird4.jpg" alt=""><p>All birds have feathers and they are very useful for lots of different reasons. Feathers help birds to fly. They also keep birds warm in the winter!</p></div>

        <h2>“The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off — and they are nearly always doing it.” </h2>
