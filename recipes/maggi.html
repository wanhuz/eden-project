<h2>Descriptions</h2>

<p>
    If you've grown up in India you've probably grown up eating Maggi for a snack! I am such a huge fan of these Instant Noodles that even today I get cravings. Which is weird I know because I'm 30 but somehow you are never too old for Maggi Noodles!
</p>

<p>And if you've grown up eating Maggi you've obviously experimented with it. Everyone I know has their favorite way of eating Maggi and I knew I had to share my favorite Maggi recipes with you guys. I mean how can I authentically be a good food blogger if I don't. Because indulging in Maggi once in a while just feels so good. It's not the best thing in the world to eat - I admit but it's like that second slice of chocolate cake that you know you can't resist.</p>
